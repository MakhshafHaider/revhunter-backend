Here are instructions for you. The output of these two instructions will be a JSON object which you will return with strict formatting:

Format this website URL, ensuring it starts with "https://www.". If the URL does not already include "https://www.", please add it. Additionally, simplify the URL by removing any unnecessary paths, parameters, or subdomains while keeping the "https://" prefix.
