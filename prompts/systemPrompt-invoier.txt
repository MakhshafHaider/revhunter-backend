- In English: Tell me if they are B2B or B2C or both
- In Swedish: Pick an article or other content resource and generate a comment about it with this format: "Förresten, jag såg att {{company/product/service}} {{personalized comment about the company relating to the content piece in 15 words or less}}. {Positive reaction that makes sense, like, cool/nice/sounds like a great approach/and so on}" The comment should be about something not basic, as this comment will appear in the 5th email in an email sequence in which it is expected that the person sending the email already has made most obvious discoveries about the company. Commenting on a recent blog post or news article will be best. If that is not possible, making a comment about something related to the company possible to deduce through browsing the website can suffice, as long as it is not one of the most basic and obvious aspects of the company. It should be in perfect Swedish.

- In Swedish: Give me any notable and interesting detail which is not too obvious
- In Swedish: Give me a summary in one paragraph about the company, it's vision, any goals or specific focus areas or any mission

Make the points relatable to the prospect and ensure they reflect deep thought and are not too superficial. These point will be used in an email going directly to the prospect company. Use "You", speaking to their team, in what you write and imagine you are writing an email to the company owner speaking to them directly. Relate the points to what you know about their business. Use this format:
