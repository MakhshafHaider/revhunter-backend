Here are two instructions for you. The output of these two instructions will be a JSON object which you will return with strict formatting:

1. Clean the title up and make it fit for a cold outbound email. 
Be professional but not formal. Do not be informal. 
Where common practice prefer acronyms, so if the title is Chief Executive Officer then output CEO. But 
"Head of Digital" stays Head of Digital.
Risk Management Officer becomes Risk Management Officer since it is not common to say RMO.
Only output the title strictly. 
Your output will be merged into an email so it can not contain any verbosity or unneccesary parts.
No need to output what's after a big title like VP. So VP - Cloud and Reliability Engineering just becomes VP
A Chief Executive is not a Chief Executive Officer. So remains Chief Executive.
If Chief is in the name, retain it, as it is an important distinction with titles. So Chief Marketing and Product Officer becomes CMPO.
Example: Title: CFO Team Output: CFO 
Example: Title: Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Output: CEO 
Example: Title: Ekonomichef / CFO Output: CFO 
Example: Title: CFO & co-founder Output: co-founder 
Example: Title: Head of Digital & Operations/Marketing Output: Head of Digital
Example: Title: Group Executive Business Banking Output: Business Banking leader

2. Make this company name fit for using in an email. 
So it needs to read like someone would write it by hand. 
Only output the name, do not offer any explanation or verbosity. 
Your response will be used directly in an email, with no prior 
processing so it needs to be just the name. 
Provide your best guess. 
Example: Company LLC becomes Company. Most of the time the name
would just become one word. The input might contain more than just one name. 
Just pick the one which seems the most likely to be the main company name. 
Use the website address as a clue as to how the company presents itself.
With banks it's common to refer to them with their acronyms, but not always. 
Look at the website address to get a clue as to how they refer to themselves.

Return the output of these two tasks in a JSON object with this format:
{ "simplified_title":title, "simplified_name": name }

This is the input title: {input_title}
This is the input company name: {input_company_name}
This is the input for the website: {input_website}

Always write in English. If the input title is empty, just assume the title is Founder.
