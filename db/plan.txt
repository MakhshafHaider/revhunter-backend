Stories:
I need to be able to upload a csv and tie it to a client and a campaign
This batch should auto-enrich after being uploaded, and I should be able to see progress.

Add new client ✅
Check that new  client exist in db ✅

Add new campaign on client ✅
Check that new campaign exists on client ✅
Check that campaign name renders in combobox ✅

Check that contacts have been rendered with right 
client and campaign ✅

I should be able to see all campaigns 
and the enrichment data thereof ✅

I should be able to trigger enrichment 
on a specific campaign 

I should be able to see clear signals on errors
and successful db inserts

finished on each row
